 Important to respect peaceful protests, non-violence: UN chief's spokesmanIn the wake of violence, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said it is important to respect peaceful protests, freedom of assembly and non-violence.

UNITED NATIONS: India has announced a pledge of $150,000 to activities of the Peacebuilding Fund this year and said that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic.
 'While I would like to assure you all of our sincere commitment to remain engaged in peacebuilding, we extend our support to the activities of the Peacebuilding Fund and as a token of our engagement, India would like to announce today a pledge of $150,000 to the fund's activities and programme this year,' India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said.
 In a virtual address to the High-Level Replenishment Conference for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund Tuesday, he said India believes that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains made over the years.
 He added that the recently concluded 2020 review of the UN peacebuilding architecture provides a framework to strengthen peace building collectively.
 He voiced appreciation that as a part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario covering a horizon of five years.
 The Fund requires 1.
5 billion dollars for 2020-2024.
 'There is no doubt that conflict prevention is essential to ensure that peacekeeping translates into something more durable for the benefit of the people,' he said, adding that for this determined support is needed from member states to strengthen the hands of the United Nations.
 He emphasised that strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance.
 'We need to consequently prioritise our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding, which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations, so that the funds are utilised to the optimum.
' UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference that peacebuilding in fragile contexts requires political courage and leadership at national and local levels, but also the right support at the right time from the international community.
 'We need to take risks for peace and enable stakeholders with the resources and space to seize opportunities.
 We have a responsibility to bring down the institutional silos and bring together, in an agile and responsive manner, the full range of the UN system capacities,' he said.
 The UN chief pointed out that as the medium-term effects of the COVID19 pandemic become more apparent, it is more important than ever to ensure the fund is adequately and predictably resourced.
 In 2020, the Peacebuilding Fund mobilised over $180 million, which Guterres said is an important sign of the trust the fund has garnered over the years and its demonstrated ability to deliver in the most difficult contexts.
 "But its resources are now depleted.
 We must urgently replenish it.
 Doing so will save lives and serve as a clear demonstration of multilateral support.
' Tirumurti highlighted India's constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia.
 India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans, apart from focusing on infrastructure, especially housing, education and health, on connectivity, providing livelihood to those impacted by conflict, especially in agriculture and on projects at the grassroots level.
 He cited the example from Afghanistan, where India has undertaken projects in every province of the country.
 India has tried to enhance the security environment of these countries since peace, security and development have to go together.
 India is also fulfilling its commitment to make available its Covid-19 vaccines to other countries and has already supplied more than six million doses to nine countries in phase one as grant assistance.
 The Peacebuilding Fund is the UN's financial instrument of first resort to sustain peace in countries or situations at risk or affected by violent conflict.
 The Fund's 2020-2024 strategy is its most ambitious yet, responding to the Secretary-General's call for a quantum leap of support for peacebuilding and prevention.
 The Fund has invested over $1.
2 billion to date in over 60 countries, with support from almost 60 member states.
 At the close of the conference, the co-chairs issued a Joint Communique stating that the General Assembly would convene a High-Level meeting on financing peace during its 76th session.
 "The Conference took place at a time of unprecedented challenges and as the world contends with the tragic immediate effects of the pandemic and its alarming medium to long-term impacts.
 The unprecedented economic shocks and inadequate response strategies are entrenching social and economic inequalities and increasing risks for crisis, eroding peace and development gains along the way," the Joint Communique said.
 Member states reiterated the importance of investing in peace.
 Including funds received for 2020, a total of 39 member states have contributed or pledged over $439 million for peacebuilding in support of the Fund's 2020-2024 Strategy which set a target of $1.
5 billion.

NEW DELHI: Farmer leaders have alleged that Punjabi singer and actor Deep Sidhu instigated protesters and led them to the iconic Red Fort and hoisted flags in the 17th-century monument.
 Famous for his role as a gangster in the Punjabi film 'Jora Das Numberia' in 2018, the 36-year-old was one of the first celebrities to support farmers when they took to the roads against the three laws.
 Sidhu, who claims to be a supporter of strengthening the federal structure to give more rights to states, has long been openly quoting Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.
 Red Fort raider Deep Sidhu has been quoting Jarnail Singh BhindranwaleLast month, the NIA registered a case against Sikhs for Justice and had also issued notices to Sidhu and his brother Mandeep Singh.
 Considered close to Sikh ideologue Ajmer Singh, Sidhu practised as a lawyer before joining the show business in 2015.
 Sidhu also did a Facebook live while hoisting the pennant from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
 In the video, Sidhu said in Punjabi, "We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag on the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest.
" Deep Sidhu &amp; government agencies behind rampage: Farm netasDeep Sidhu belong to Muktsar in Punjab and had held a prolonged protest at the Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana, where accusations of Khalistani elements running the protests had been made.

 However, Deol distanced himself from Sidhu in a tweet, saying he or his family had no relationship with him.
 "I am deeply saddened by what happened at the Red Fort today.
 On December 6 itself, I had clarified on Twitter that I and my family have nothing to do with Deep Sidhu.

Huge relief for spouses of H-1B workers, Biden nixes Trump plan to kill H-4 work permits

NEW YORK: "Withdrawn".
 A single word on a thick bureaucratic file on the seventh day of the Biden administration delivered a huge win for spouses of workers on H-1B visas in the US who spent the last four years worried sick that their work authorisations would be killed off.
 The latest development brings to an end years of effort by the Donald Trump administration to rescind an Obama era regulation that allowed a certain subset of spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US.
 Up until the summer of 2015, H-4 visa holders could not legally hold paid employment in the United States.
 Almost as soon as Obama changed the game, the lawsuits followed and then the Trump presidency took the attack on the H-4 work permit to a whole new level.
 On text messages, chat groups and online threads, the outpouring of relief played out online on Tuesday evening.
 "Great news! Hopefully H4EAD delays will be ending soon which is leading to a long wait for dependent spouses," tweeted Rashi Bhatnagar.
 Sharmistha Mohapatra posted, "Big win for H4 EAD holders today.
 Former Pres Trump's EO to rescind H4 EAD is now withdrawn by POTUS.
 Let's hope excruciating long wait times often resulting in job loss is taken away too!" From the time the skewering of the H-4 work permit (called the EAD) began in Fall 2017, the proposed rule has been published seven times for ongoing review, keeping the H-4 community on cliff-edge.
 The Trump government justified the move saying it is "economically significant" and aligns with the "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, which was mostly code for keeping foreign workers out of the US and flinging red meat to the Trump base.
 Now, the backlink to that Trump executive order ends up as a 404 (page not found) error and re-routes to the Biden White House.
 "Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorization" was a Trumpian agenda pursued by White House immigration hawks with intense zeal and inter-agency collaboration.
 It was being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), where it was parked for months.
 The pressure on the H4 community never really let up since Trump took office.
 The decision to rescind the proposed rule on revoking the H4 work permit came on the same day Biden signed an executive order calling for the practice of racial equity in the United States.
 Data from the US government show that Indian and Chinese workers account for the lion's share of H-1B visas.
 H-4 visas typically follow the same trajectory.
 Indians filed 74 per cent of all H-1B petitions in fiscal year 2019.
 Chinese filed 11.
8 per cent.

NEW DELHI: The world is on verge of defeating the coronavirus pandemic by adopting preemptive, proactive and collaborative strategies to combat the virus, said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday.
 "I thank member nations that despite the wide disparity in their epidemiological trends, we're on verge of defeating pandemic by adopting preemptive, proactive and collaborative strategies," said the Union health minister at 148th session of WHO Executive Board (virtual) meeting.
 Speaking about the year that was marred by the pandemic, he said, "2020 was the year of science when the best of humanity was shown through the gloom that descended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
 The situation demanded setting up of major global collaboration so that scientists could share their expertise.
 For these governments, business and philanthropic organisations got together to start committing resources.
" On the efforts being undertaken globally to fight Covid-19, Harsh Vardhan added: "All member states are doing their utmost to overcome challenges and improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of health care services.
 But the job isn't finished here.
 So we must redouble our commitment to putting an end to the pandemic.
" "In the present context, nowhere is safe until everywhere is safe.
 At the WHO, we have ensured that the low and middle-income countries have access to safe and effective Covid-19 tests, treatment and vaccine.
" Over the post-Covid world, he said, "The post-Covid world will be filled with challenges.
 To overcome them, WHO needs to be a trailblazer, empowered to work towards a new vision that allows it to realise its full potential and strengthen health care systems across member nations.
" Harsh Vardhan's statement comes as the worldwide tally of Covid-19 cases surpassed the 100 million mark on Wednesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 The United States continues to be the worst affected country with 25,407,414 cases.

NEW DELHI: Robust ambulance services and highway patrol teams can reduce road deaths drastically as was evident in Tamil Nadu where road crash fatalities fell by 54% in 4 years ' from 17,218 fatalities in 2016 to 7,287 in 2020.
 While Rajasthan, Karnataka and Kerala are keen to adopt the Tamil Nadu model, Maharashtra on Tuesday announced to implement it.
 Venkatesh Balasubramanian of IIT-M on Tuesday said even if the 2020 road crash and death data are not taken into consideration because of the lockdown, Tamil Nadu has been recording continuous decline in fatalities since 2016.
 Now the road transport ministry and World Bank will propagate the TN model ' identifying the exact cause of fatalities, ambulance reaching site within 13 minutes, rectifying crash spots and smooth coordination among various agencies ' which others can adopt to check the number of road deaths.
 The state deploys ambulances after identifying accident-prone locations, which has reduced response time considerably.
 Balasubramanian said one of the focuses is to save as many lives as possible in case of any crash.
 India loses 415 lives per day in road crashes, the most across the globe.
 'If we keep waiting till 2030, at least 6-7 lakh people will die due to road accidents.
 If Tamil Nadu can do it, all states can make progress,' Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said while launching the month-long Road Safety campaign.
 Elaborating about Tamil Nadu, a state transport department official said the steps include collection of robust data on accidents, identifying and elimination of 'black spots', providing emergency response and healthcare, educating drivers on safe driving and enforcement by police and the transport wing.
 The state transport minister holds a meeting of all wings concerned on road safety every third month and the collector of each district chairs a meeting every month.
 Performance on the road safety front has been made a critical input while analysing the performance of field officers in their annual performance reports.
 Times View: Tamil Nadu must be congratulated for coming up with a successful model that helps reduce road deaths.
 It would be even better if other states adopt this model, with necessary local tweaks.
 India is the world's road death capital.
 The sooner the tag is lost, the better.

Protests by farmers and their supporters against the agri-marketing laws were by and large peaceful in states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.
 In Karnataka, there were tractors rallies of varying size in support of the protest in Delhi.
 Members of some 50 outfits participated in a demonstration in Bengaluru that involved 125 tractors and other vehicles under the Aikhya (United) Forum.
 There were a few reports of minor skirmishes with the police from other parts of the state, while some farmers' groups threatened to intensify the agitation on the lines of the Delhi stir if the Centre failed to withdraw the laws.
 Over 5,000 tractors headed towards Bengaluru were stopped.
 Federation of Farmers' Associations Kurubur Shanthkumar warned of a larger agitation.
 ' In Telangana, hundreds of people chanting 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan' hit the streets in Hyderabad.
 Organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, the rally comprised participants from the Left parties, civil rights groups and women's groups.
 The tractor rally at the Shahjahanpur-Kherhi border in Haryana's Rewari district saw farmers, labourers, fishermen and tribals from seven states participate.
 The rally, which began at Rewari after tricolour was unfurled at the venue, reached Manesar via Bawal and returned by the same route without any controversial incident.
 It included 26 makeshift tableaux on trolleys highlighting the art, culture, heritage and source of income of 26 states.
 'Hum iss tractor parade se dil jeetne aaye hain, naa ki Dilli jeetne (We want to win the hearts of people with this parade, not Delhi),' Samyukta Morcha local coordinator Sanjay Madhav said.
 In Mumbai, protesters headed home after flag-hoisting at Azad Maidan, the All India Kisan Sabha said.
 In Tamil Nadu, farmers and trade union members ignored warnings from police and took out rallies on tractors and twowheelers involving several people in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvaur and Trichy.

NEW DELHI: With events around 'Kisan Republic Day Parade' going against their proclaimed script of peaceful protest, farm unions' umbrella body, Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), on Tuesday disassociated itself from violent incidents in the heart of the capital and blamed 'some organisations and individuals' for violating the planned routes and indulging in 'condemnable' acts.
 'Antisocial elements have infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement.
 We have always held that peace is our biggest strength, and that any violation would hurt the movement,' said the Morcha in a statement, issued after hundreds of protesters jumped police barricades and reached ITO and Red Fort in central Delhi.
 As the protesters stationed themselves at various sites in the city, SKM called off the 'Kisan Republic Day Parade' on Tuesday evening and appealed to all participants to immediately return to their respective protest sites on Delhi borders ' Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri.
 It said the 'movement will continue peacefully and further steps will be discussed and decided soon'.
 SKM leaders later said the events on Tuesday would not affect their plan to hold a protest march on foot towards Parliament on the Budget Day on February 1.
 Though the Morcha has not identified the organisations and individuals responsible for violence during the tractor rally, leaders hinted at those associated with Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) ' the group which had rejected the route plan finalised by SKM with Delhi Police on the eve of the Republic Day.
 KMSC's Punjab unit general secretary Sarvan Singh Pandher had on Monday announced to start its parade towards Outer Ring Road at 8am on Tuesday ' ahead of SKM's agreed plan to start the tractor rally after conclusion of the official parade at Rajpath.
 Regretting the 'undesirable and unacceptable events', the SKM said, 'We dissociate ourselves from all such elements that have violated our discipline.

UNITED NATIONS: India has informed the UN Security Council that it will gradually supply vaccines to the Covax facility of the World Health Organisation and undertake contractual supplies to various countries in a phased manner, as more than six million doses have been airlifted to nine countries under New Delhi's 'vaccine diplomacy.
' 'As the largest vaccine-producing country of the world, we are fulfilling our commitment to make our vaccine production and delivery capacity available for the benefit of the entire humanity,' India's deputy permanent representative to the UN ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said on Monday.
 Speaking at the UNSC briefing on 'Maintenance of international peace and security : Follow-up on the implementation of resolution 2532', Naidu said two vaccines have already been granted approval for emergency use in India and the country plans to vaccinate about 300 million citizens in the first six months.
 Covax is the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level.

TEXT:
NEW DELHI: A new report highlights that women are likely to bear the brunt of job losses during the pandemic because much of their work is invisible, and they are likely to work in informal work arrangements.
 An Oxfam India report ' 'The Inequality Virus' in a section on livelihood draws upon reports and data to point that women who were employed before the lockdown are also 23.
5 percentage points less likely to be re-employed compared to men in the post-lockdown phase.
 The report cites different data sets, reports and surveys to underline the increasing inequalities in the backdrop of the pandemic in a wide range of sectors and the growing gaps in sectors like education, health and livelihood among others.
 In a section on 'Women bear the Brunt', it is pointed that 17 million women lost their jobs in April 2020.
 Therefore, unemployment for women rose by 15% from a pre-lockdown level of 18%.
 This increase in unemployment of women can result in a loss to India's GDP of about 8% or $218 billion.
 It is also pointed that the work-from-home culture has also blurred the lines between working hours and personal downtime.
 Women have been working longer hours and simultaneously managing the daily chores of the household, the educational needs of the children and care for all members of the family.
 The report said frontline health workers such as ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) whose work can be seen as an extension of care work have experienced a phenomenal increase in their work.
 'But the remuneration is way too measly ' a mere Rs 1,000 for the Covid-19 duties assigned to them.
 It is estimated that if India's top 11 billionaires are taxed at just 1% on their wealth, the government can pay the average wage of the nine lakh ASHA workers in the country for 5 years,' said the report.
 Reflecting on the overall scenario, the report highlights that the economic fallout of the pandemic manifested in job losses and salary cuts for both informal and formal sectors.
 'The job loss for the low-income households with no other alternative earnings and no social security has been the most troubling and will find it extremely difficult to cope with and recover from the slowdown,' pointed out the report.

 Dujarric was responding to a question on whether the UN Secretariat or the Secretary General had any comment on the "renewed India-China border clashes".
 Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a clash in the high-altitude Naku La region in North Sikkim on January 20, an incident described by the Indian Army on Monday as a "minor face-off".
 In a statement, the Indian Army said the face-off was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols.
 Chinese authorities though have denied any knowledge about the incident claiming that the PLA didn't have any record of the clash.

AYODHYA: Unfurling of the tricolour and tree plantation on India's 72nd Republic Day marked the formal launch of the Ayodhya mosque project at Dhannipur village, 25km off Ramjanmabhoomi, exactly six months after the Sunni Waqf Board constituted the mosque trust ' Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation ' following the 2019 Supreme Court verdict that mandated construction of a temple at Ramjanmabhoomi and a mosqut in the district in lieu of the Babri Masjid.
 The tricolour was hoisted by trust chairman Zufar Ahmad Farooqui, and nine saplings were planted at the site by its members amid cheer from villagers of Dhannipur, a nondescript hamlet which catapulted into fame after a 5-acre plot adjacent to a century-old Sufi shrine was allotted for the mosque.
 Holding afloat Ayodhya's secular and syncretic moorings, three members of the Hindu community, including a prominent RSS functionary made generous donations for mosque construction on the occasion.
 While professor RK Singh of Awadh University and his wife Dr Sunita Sengar donated Rs 22,000, RSS member Dr Anil Singh, who is also president of Ayodhya's Muslim Rashtriya Manch, donated Rs 2,100.
 To recall, the first donation of Rs 21,000 for the mosque project came from a Hindu academic from Lucknow University, Rohit Srivastava, last year.
 Talking to TOI, Singh said, 'Majority Hindus will support construction of this mosque in Ayodhya along with the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi and this is the best example of communal harmony.
' Talking to TOI, trust secretary Athar Hussain, said, 'The trust chose January 26 for laying the foundation of the mosque as on this day the Constitution came into effect more than seven decades ago.
' The new mosque will be bigger than Babri masjid, but won't be a lookalike of the structure which once stood in Ramjanmabhoomi premises.
 'The hospital will hold centrestage and will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the prophet 1,400 years ago,' Farooqui said.

MHOW: A missed salute alerted Army intelligence to an imposter, dressed in the uniform of a Bihar Regiment jawan, in Mhow cantonment on Republic Day.
 The suspect, 24-year-old Mithun Verma, was taking pictures of different areas of the cantonment in Indore district when he was nabbed, said Mhow sub-divisional police officer Vinod Sharma.
 When Mithun was clicking photos of the Infantry Museum on Mall Road, an officer was passing by and noticed that the 'sepoy' did not salute him, said sources.
 His suspicions aroused, the officer checked Mithun and began asking questions.
 The Bihar Regiment badge on the imposter's beret was inverted and he wasn't able to answer where he was posted at present.
 The officer alerted intelligence officials and an Army quick reaction team swiftly took him into custody.
 Mithun carried colour photographs of a fake identity card and the CSD canteen card of a soldier on his mobile phone, Sharma said.
 'Army and police found that he had three sets of brand new Army uniforms and his mobile had pictures of soldiers posted at Mhow.
 Our investigation is on,' he added.
 Upon interrogation, he confessed that he worked as a private security guard in an aluminum factory in Pithampur industrial area, police said.
 He is a native of Kodiakhedi village in Rajgarh district, some 200km from Mhow.
 Sources said that Mithun had tried to join the armed forces but couldn't make it past the selection stage.
 Then, he started posing as a soldier with the 10 Bihar Regiment before villagers and his own family.
 Army officers are interrogating Mithun to trace the source of the forged IDs.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said he would appeal to the agitating farmers to go back to their respective villages peacefully so that there was no scope for the Narendra Modi government to blame them in the wake of mishandling of the situation in the Capital.
 Pawar reacted sharply to the handling of the agitation and said, 'The Centre is determined to ignore the agitation and hence there was no dialogue between the agitating farmers and nominees of the government.
 Whatever happened in New Delhi today, no one will endorse, but it was high time to study why such a situation arose.
 All out efforts were made to crush the agitation by using massive force.
 It will have massive repercussions.
 We have seen Punjab disturbed, now it is the responsibility of the Modi government to ensure that Punjab remains peaceful.
' The veteran pointed out that ever since the farmers' agitation began in New Delhi, it had remained apolitical and it was expected that the government would initiate dialogue and find an amicable solution, but the government was determined to crush the agitation.
 'In Mumbai, thousands of farmers had gathered to support agitating farmers in New Delhi, but the law-enforcing agencies in Maharashtra observed restraint.
 As a result, it was a peaceful agitation,' he added.
 Launching a frontal attack on the Modi government, Pawar said the Centre introduced the three legislations in Parliament without adequate consultations.
 'Proper procedure should have been followed, all sections should have been taken into confidence,' he said.
 Other opposition parties too condemned the clashes but said the Centre was squarely responsible for allowing the protests to fester.
 Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee condemned the clashes with similar caveats.
 'Centre's insensitive attitude and indifference towards our farmer brothers and sisters has to be blamed.
 First, three laws were passed without taking farmers in confidence.
 And then, despite protests across India and farmers camping near Delhi for two months, they've been extremely casual in dealing with them,' she said.
 Left members, who have backed the protests, also joined the march on Tuesday.
 CPM's Sitaram Yechury condemned all violence but demanded that the PM announce immediate repeal of the laws.
 'The republic is of the public.
 The tantra in 'ganatantra' has no meaning without the 'gana'.
 The protests are for a legitimate demand of millions of farmers, that remains the issue at hand and must be resolved.

 Congress's position was, however, modified in a late evening statement that seemed to take into account the negative fallout of the violence, including a raid on the Red Fort on Republic Day.
 "The protesters should keep their objective in mind.
 Non-violence and satyagraha have been the biggest success of this protest led by farmers and workers.
 We strongly hope that this coalition of farmers, workers and the poor will continue on its path of non-violence and peaceful protest and stay firm for the repeal of the three farm laws,' the party said.
 The worry in Congress ranks was that violence on Republic Day would undercut any sympathy gained over the last four months by peaceful protests.
 There was nervousness over a religious flag hoisted on the Red Fort ramparts by some protesters.
 Rahul, in a tweet early in the day, said, 'Violence is not the solution to any problem.
 If anyone gets hurt, the damage will happen to our country.
 Take back the anti-agricultural law for the benefit of the country.
' Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh voiced concern over the violence most directly when he called the development 'shocking scenes in Delhi'.
 He suggested the violence was carried out by 'some elements' who were not 'genuine farmers', and that farmers' leaders had disassociated themselves from it.
 'It will negate the goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers.
 I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi and return to the borders,' he added.
 Hours earlier, in his R-Day address, Singh had lashed out at the Modi government for the farm laws, lack of consultation and sidelining of Punjab when the laws were framed.
 Others who voiced their worry included former minister Shashi Tharoor who said, "Most unfortunate.
 I have supported the farmers' protests from the start but I cannot condone lawlessness.
 And on Republic Day, no flag but the sacred tiranga must fly on Red Fort.
" Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Gill said, "There is place for only one flag at the Red Fort and that is our tricolour, tiranga.
 Hoisting/putting any other flag irrespective of demands is unacceptable.
 We all serve the nation and nothing else is above that.
 People resorting to such tactics are hurting the cause of farmers.
" But Congress chose to remind that the provocation was the three farm laws and the procrastination on the part of the government through 'endless talks'.
 Party spokesman Randeep Surjewala called it an attempt to 'tire out' the farmers and said 175 farmers had died during the last 61 days of protest, but without succeeding in moving prime minister Narendra Modi into showing some sympathy.

NEW DELHI: While there was no official statement from BJP, several party leaders reacted angrily to the violent protests by farmers in the national Capital even as they maintained that the violence had showed that farm leaders had no control over their followers and that they were acting as 'puppets' of opposition parties.
 BJP leaders said the government trusted the assurance given by farmers that the tractor rally would be on specified routes, trolleys would not be taken out and that they would be unarmed.
 'The protesting farmers have violated all promises they made to the government, which shows the ulterior motive of the farmers, who are working on the directions of a desperate opposition,' a senior BJP functionary said.
 The leader said Delhi Police had showed utmost restraint even as they were beaten otherwise things could have been far worse.
 'BJP has maintained right from the beginning that it is committed to the welfare of farmers.
 However, the way Red Fort was desecrated, the whole nation has watched it and there is nothing left to say about the hidden agenda of the farm union leaders, who are acting as per the dictation of opposition parties,' the BJP leader said.
 'Common farmers should understand that the ongoing agitation is the handiwork of a few middlemen, who are fearing that the hefty money they were fleecing from farmers will come to an end,' he added.
 'While we are saluting the national flag, some elements supported by so-called 'progressives' are relishing insulting the same, and remember in the name of Constitution,' BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe tweeted.
 'Can farmers of the country do what was witnessed in Delhi today?' asked party general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya.
 BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi recalled sacrifices made by several icons of the country to protect and preserve freedom and sovereignty of the nation, which was attacked by a group of 'shameless' vandals.
 'Those being perceived as 'annadata' have turned out to be terrorists.
 Don't defame our farmers and terrorists must be called terrorists,' he added.
 Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey equated the farm leaders with Hurriyat leaders and demanded that farmers chiefs like Yogendra Yadav, Rakesh Tikait and Hannan Mollah be booked on charges of sedition.

BATHINDA: Punjabi actor-singer-activist Deep Sidhu, who farmer unions allege was responsible for taking youths towards Red Fort on Tuesday, has been making news from the beginning of the agitation since September last year.
 Famous for his role as a gangster in the Punjabi film 'Jora Das Numberia' in 2018, the 36-year-old was one of the first celebrities to support farmers when they took to the roads against the three laws.
 Before moving to the protest site at Singhu border, Deep Sidhu, who belongs to Muktsar in Punjab, had held a prolonged protest at Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana, where accusations of Khalistani elements running the protests had been made.
 Actor Deep Sidhu addresses farmers at Ghazipur during their 'Delhi Chalo' protest against the Centre's farm reform laws, in New Delhi.
 (PTI)Farmers protest: Live updatesDuring the Lok Sabha elections in May 2019, Deep Sidhu was in the news for being close to Bollywood actor-politician Sunny Deol, who contested from Gurdaspur as a BJP candidate.
 Deep Sidhu was seen participating in his campaign.
 However, Deol distanced himself from Sidhu in a tweet, saying he or his family had no relationship with him.
 Raid Fort: When rampaging mob took ramparts by stormA video clip featuring Deep Sidhu raising slogans at the Red Fort has also gone viral since Tuesday afternoon.
 Later, in a video on his Facebook account, Deep Sidhu said when genuine rights or concerns are not addressed, anger is bound to flare up in any protest.
 'We cannot accuse any individual for whatever happened.
 Protests as big as this are not dependent on an individual.
 We reached Red Fort to symbolically register our protest, to exercise our democratic right and not to challenge the unity and diversity of the country.
 We have put up Nishan Sahib and Kisan flag on an empty post.
 The Tricolour was not removed.
 No one should see it in a communal light.
 It was part of unity in diversity.
 Nishan Sahib symbolises the fight against injustice,' it said.
 Deep Sidhu &amp; government agencies behind rampage: Farm netasHe was till recently close to gangster-turned activist Lakha Sidhana who was seen trying to pacify protesting youths on Monday at Singhu border and objected to the route of the rally allowed by the police.
 Sidhu, who claims to be a supporter of the idea of strengthening the federal structure to give more rights to states, has long been openly quoting Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.
 The NIA had last month registered a case against Sikhs for Justice and had also issued notices to Sidhu and his brother Mandeep Singh.
 Considered close to Sikh ideologue Ajmer Singh, Sidhu practised as a lawyer before he joined the show business in 2015.

BATHINDA: Farm leaders on Tuesday evening blamed the Majha-based Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and Deep Sidhu - who had led a group to Red Fort - for the violence in the national capital and termed the entire episode as 'the handiwork of some central agencies' to defame the farmers' struggle.
 Sources in the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that the foundation for the unruly scenes was laid late on Monday evening when ruckus was created at the Samyukt Morcha stage and some youngsters along with gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana had taken command of the stage from where it was openly announced that they would go on the route as planned earlier as some were talking about heading towards Red Fort.
 BKU-Rajewal leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said: 'I had said that if we remain peaceful we will win, but if we go for violence we may not win.
 Now those who took farmers to wrong routes are responsible for all this.
 We will introspect as to why and how it all happened.
' Farm leader Rajinder Singh blamed central agencies and said, 'Deep Sidhu too did not play a positive role.
' BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, 'What happened is unfortunate and we will look into all this and see what went wrong as it seemed central agencies succeeded in making their scheme work.
' BKU Haryana leader Gurnam Singh Charuni criticised Deep Sidhu for misleading youth to Red Fort and described him as a 'dalal (agent)' of the Union government.
 He made it clear that the farmers' agitation was not religious and it would remain the same in future.
 In a video released on Tuesday evening, Charuni cautioned people to beware of Deep Sidhu and said, 'It is condemnable to give it a religious colour, whatever incident has happened today at Lal Qila (Red Fort).
 Our andolan (protest) is of the farmers only and a mass movement, which is not at all a religious one.
 And whatever Deep Sidhu has done, we condemn it in strong words and we feel that he is a dalal (agent) of the government who is messing up from many days.
 Every time, he speaks against the farm leaders and misleads against them.
 Whatever he did today is highly condemnable as we had not given any such call of going to Lal Qila.

NEW DELHI: Violence during the tractor rallies came as a setback for farm unions agitating for repeal of central farm laws.
 However, they expressed their determination to continue with their protests while seeking to dissociate themselves from Tuesday's violence.
 The unions said that there were no plans to abandon the march to Parliament on Budget day, though neither the courts nor the Central government may be accommodative this time.
 The farm unions, which have received favourable notice so far, will find themselves being closely questioned over the manner in which their rally spun out of control and resulted in chaos in Delhi on Republic Day.
 Red Fort raider Deep Sidhu has been quoting Jarnail Singh BhindranwaleUnion leaders do not appear ready to give up on their core demands ' repeal of laws and legal guarantee to minimum support price (MSP) 'and some of them feel that their protests are acquiring a larger dimension.
 The unions will in any case want to wait to see how opposition parties take up the stir in the Budget session, which begins on Friday.
 Farmers protest: Live updatesThe likely stand of the Central government, which has so far been at pains to signal its flexibility to amend the laws ' short of repeal ' was not clear though BJP leaders were taken aback by the violence.
 The government and BJP offered no word on the violence, with sources saying the priority was to restore law and order.
 The government seemed to expect the televised events to hurt the protest, while the proceedings in the Supreme Court, which had asked if the rally would be peaceful, could also see the Centre spelling out its stand.
 What is Nishan Sahib? It's found flying atop every gurdwaraSo far, the government has been careful in not using coercive methods, keeping in mind the sensitivity of Punjab, from where most of the unions are from, being a border state and the likely role of extremists in exploiting the situation.
 The unions said they had mobilised some organisations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal to intensify the agitation.
 All these states, along with Assam and Manipur, witnessed protests on Tuesday.
 Until now, the mobilisation has been largely cadre-based with the Left-aligned All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) playing a leading role.

NEW DELHI: The script had been read out and the red lines drawn, but nothing went as planned when the farmers took out their tractor rally on Tuesday.
 A dash to the heart of Delhi on speeding tractors that rammed barricades and even threatened to mow down policemen, widespread vandalism and destruction of public property and prolonged clashes with the cops marred a two-month-long peaceful agitation on the farm laws.
 This was capped with the unfurling of the Sikh religious flag, Nishan Sahib, at Red Fort even as cops were battling the protesters in the foreground.
 The leaders who had promised a peaceful march and should have reined in the hotheads did the disappearing act and the volunteers who were supposed to keep the rally on course were not be seen anywhere.
 This was a pyrrhic victory, bitter harvest of what turned out to be a rudderless agitation when it came to hitting the streets.
 Police showed extraordinary restraint as use of force against farmers was never on the table during discussions amongst the brass.
 However, this strategy landed over 120 cops in the hospital, half of them with severe injuries.
 A few are critical and in ICU.
 A farmer driving a tractor dangerously crashed into barricades near ITO and died on the spot.
 Protestors put flags atop a dome after breaching the route during the tractor rally at Red Fort.
 Ignoring the schedule of 12pm to 5pm that had been agreed upon for the tractor rally, the protesters at Singhu and Ghazipur borders had begun challenging the cops as early as 6.
30am.
 They soon began making attempts to break through the barricades.
 This was even before the Republic Day parade had begun.
 By 8am, the barricades at Singhu were down and 45 minutes later, Tikri too had been breached.
 The tractor rally was on, still on course.
 By 10am, around 6,000-7,000 tractors had entered Delhi, cocking a snook at police and violating virtually all mutually agreed terms and conditions.
 When this group reached Mukarba Chowk on G T Karnal Road around 10.
40am, it insisted on moving towards Central Delhi, instead of going on the predesignated route.
 The cops tried to reason with them but the farmers, led by Nihangs on horses carrying swords and kirpans, charged at police and broke several layers of barricades between Mukarba Chowk and Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar.
 The protesters were teargassed and mild force used but to no avail.

 (PTI )Meanwhile, a section of farmers at Ghazipur border smashed the barricades at several points and headed towards ITO, through Akshardham and Millennium Park, where they were joined by some farmers from Singhu.
 Things were getting chaotic at Tikri too.
 Here, a section of the protesters refused to turn towards Najafgarh and insisted on marching towards Peeragarhi and Central Delhi, leading to day-long clashes with the cops.
 However, it was at ITO that the protesters met with stiff resistance from the cops which turned the intersection into a battleground.
 The farmers turned violent and broke barricades, damaged iron railings and dividers and even tried to run over the policemen with their tractors.
 Around 12.
35pm, the cops fired teargas shells and lathicharged the protesters, setting off a cat-and-mouse game.
 The protesters pelted the cops with stones.
 A tractor smashes its way past a barricade at Akshardham.
With the arrival of reinforcements after the conclusion of the R-Day parade, police succeeded in stopping them from entering the New Delhi district and moving towards Parliament.
 One section of protesters then turned towards Red Fort with another staying put on Vikas Marg.
 Having reached the ramparts of Red Fort, the protesters hoisted the Nishan Sahib amidst much cheering even as police were being attacked in the vicinity.
 It was only late at night that some order could be restored and the crowd removed from the area.
 The clashes between police and farmers continued throughout the day.
 Most of the incidents were reported from Mukarba Chowk, Ghazipur, ITO, Seemapuri, Nangloi, Tikri Border and Red Fort.
 Delhi Police ' caught between overseeing R-Day security and handling the spiralling violence ' used mild force, including teargas, and suspended internet at many places.
 The request for the latter was made by the special cell to the home ministry which gave the order without much of an impact.
 According to intelligence officials, things spun out of control as the protesters were virtually leaderless.
 While the talks had been held with the elderly union leaders, youngsters took charge on Tuesday morning, refusing to heed any counselling or instructions by police, with the leaders having disappeared from the scene.
 Reacting to the day's developments, police commissioner S N Shrivastava said, "The time and the routes for the tractor rally were finalised after several rounds of meetings.
 But the farmers drove their tractors off the routes and before the fixed time, leading to vandalism in which many police personnel were injured.
" "Public property has also been damaged.
 I appeal to the protesting farmers not to indulge in violence, maintain peace and return through the designated routes," he added.

GHAZIABAD: Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that some antisocial elements were behind the violence during the farmers' tractor parade in the national capital on Tuesday.
 It was due to the Delhi Police's 'actions' that some anti-social elements entered the parade and caused the violence, he said.
 The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesman in a statement also alleged that the Delhi Police had wrongly placed barricades at some places of the pre-decided routes of the parade.
 "This was done intentionally to misguide farmers," Tikait said, adding that because of this, farmers on tractors went astray.
 This gave anti-social elements the opportunity to enter the tractor rally, he claimed.
 BKU believes in peaceful demonstration and will identify the miscreants behind the violence.
 Tikait urged protesting farmers to keep themselves away from violence.
 The coordination committee members of the parade will look into the reasons behind the violence, he said.
 Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting against the Centre's new agri laws at various Delhi border points since November last year and on Tuesday, they took out tractor parades in the national capital.
 Ghaziabad District Information Officer (DIO) Rakesh Chauhan said in a statement that the tractor rally culminated peacefully in Ghaziabad and no untoward incident occurred.
 The administration had made adequate arrangements and senior police and civil officials interacted with farmer leaders every day, it said.

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana Cabinet held a special meeting here on Tuesday evening under the chairmanship of chief minister M L Khattar in the wake of the events that unfolded in the national capital during the tractor parade and appealed to all protesting farmers to return to their homes.
 Khattar said farmer unions had assured a peaceful tractor rally in the national capital.
 "But the events which unfolded today make it clear that this agitation is now not under the control of these farmer leaders.
 And the command of this agitation is now in the hands of such anarchic elements whose ideology is different from the farmers' interests," he said.
 The chief minister issued a statement asking the farmer community to ponder over where their agitation was headed.
 "The entire Haryana cabinet, through its special meeting held today, humbly appeals to all farmers of this agitation to return to their homes.
 The strong need of the hour this time is that together we defeat the designs of the anti-social elements," Khattar said.
 Earlier, he described as "most unfortunate" the incident of a protesting farmer hoisting a religious flag at the Red Fort.
 Such an incident at Red Fort on Republic Day is strongly condemnable, Khattar had said.
 "In a democratic setup, there is adequate space to resolve issues through dialogue," he said, referring to the farmers who have been sitting in protest for two months near Delhi's borders against the Centre's new farm laws.
 But no Indian will tolerate anyone hoisting any flag other than the tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Khattar said.
 This is an insult to those freedom fighters and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of this nation, he added.
 The freedom fighters did not fight for the country's independence to see the spread of this type of anarchy, Khattar said.

AKOLA: Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar on Tuesday termed the Modi government as "anti-farmer" and condemned the police action against protesters during a tractor parade taken out by cultivators in Delhi.
 He said it was unfortunate that such an incident took place on the Republic Day in Delhi, where violence broke out during a tractor parade taken out by farmers protesting against the Centre's new agri-marketing laws.
 Talking to reporters here, Ambedkar dubbed the Modi government as "anti-farmer" and said it should be more sensitive towards cultivators.
 "August 15 and January 26 are very important days for the country.
 It is wrong to charge protesters with sticks on this day.
 We condemn this incident.
 The government should be sensitive," he said.
 Earlier, Ambedkar flagged off a tractor rally organised in Akola city by a farm outfit in support of cultivators protesting against the Centre's new agri-marketing laws.
 Tens of thousands of farmers broke barriers to storm the national capital, their tractor parade to highlight their demands dissolving into unprecedented scenes of anarchy as they fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult hoisting a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India's tricolour.
 Clashes broke out in multiple places, leading to violence in well-known landmarks of Delhi and its suburbs.
 While there were no exact estimates of how many farmers were hurt, Delhi Police officials said 86 of their men were injured.
 Police baton charged farmers at Chintamani Chowk in Delhi when they broke barricades and smashed window panes of cars.
 The Delhi police used teargas shells to disperse the restive crowds in some places.

TEXT:
UNITED NATIONS: India on Tuesday said that normalisation of relations between Israel and some Arab states is an important development that has the potential to promote regional cooperation for peace and security and can provide the necessary momentum for resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine.
 India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti made the comments at the Security Council open debate on 'The Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
' "The normalisation of relations between Israel and some member states of the League of Arab states is also an important development, which has the potential to promote regional cooperation for peace, security and prosperity.
 Further, this can provide the necessary momentum for resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine,' he said.
 Former US President Donald Trump had in September last year hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain for the signing of the historic Abraham Accord, the first Arab-Israeli peace deal in 26 years.
 Until then, the only Arab nations to recognise Israel were Jordan and Egypt.
 In October last year, Israel and Sudan agreed to take steps to normalise relations in a diplomatic coup announced by Trump days before the 2020 US elections.
 In December, Morocco agreed to resume diplomatic relations with Israel under a deal brokered by the US.
 Tirumurti said India has always called for a just and comprehensive solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and has welcomed all peaceful efforts to achieve the two-State solution, through direct negotiations between the two parties.
 In this context, India reiterated its support for Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas' call to hold an international peace conference with the participation of all relevant parties to achieve the vision of a sovereign and independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel.
 He emphasised that India has committed itself and contributed to the efforts towards bringing lasting peace and stability in the region through deployment of Indian personnel as part of UN peacekeeping forces, including in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, through substantial and timely humanitarian assistance, and through development cooperation and capacity building.
 'India proposes to supply vaccines to the region to help the countries fight the Covid-19 pandemic,' he said.
 On the broader regional developments, India welcomed the signing of the Al-Ula Declaration, which has ushered in rapprochement and reconciliation among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
 New Delhi acknowledges the key role of a unified GCC in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region, Tirumurti said.
 Terming the commencement of talks between Israel and Lebanon last year as a significant development, Tirumurti said India looks forward to the swift formation of the Government in Lebanon that can offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon.
 'India will continue to stand by Lebanon during its time of need,' he said.
 India welcomed the announcement of convening legislative, presidential and national council elections later this year in Palestine and urged all parties to take necessary further steps to ensure that these elections are held smoothly, fulfilling the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people.
 Noting that it is heartening to see positive developments with regard to the Israel-Palestine issue, Tirumurti said India acknowledges and appreciates the efforts, inter alia, of Egypt in the process of rapprochement between the Palestinian parties, thereby bringing them together to end the internal divide.
 'The resumption of civil and security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority has also begun to alleviate the situation on the ground in Palestinian territories,' he said.
 Tirumurti also voiced support for the efforts of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland to resume the peace process, including through revitalising the Quartet, and help mediate the peace negotiations.
 'We also take note of the joint efforts by Egypt, Jordan, France and Germany aimed at strengthening the collective commitment on the part of the international community to facilitate the peace process,' he said.
 Highlighting India's engagement with Palestine, Tirumurti said New Delhi has been consistently supporting Palestinian nation-building efforts through human resource development and institutional building.
 India is currently undertaking several projects in many sectors, including health, education and, technology of around $72 million.
 India has also supplied critical life saving drugs and medical equipment to Palestine as assistance during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.
 As an incoming member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Advisory Committee, India underscored its commitment to continue strengthening its contribution to the Agency.
 New Delhi has made a multi-year enhanced annual financial contribution of five million dollars to support UNRWA's work in providing humanitarian assistance and essential services, he said.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana was put on high alert on Tuesday and mobile internet services were suspended in three districts of Sonipat, Jhajjar and Palwal until 5 pm Wednesday, the state government said, as violent farmers' protest rocked neighbouring Delhi.
 In the wake of the events which unfolded in the national capital, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a special meeting of his cabinet and appealed to all farmers to return to their homes.
 The need of the hour is to together defeat the designs of antisocial elements, said Khattar.
 He also chaired a high level meeting with senior officials including Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan, Home Secretary Rajeev Arora and Director General of Police Manoj Yadava here in the evening to take stock of the situation.
 The DGP said a high alert has been sounded in the state in view of the violent incidents in several areas during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi.
 He directed all district police chiefs to be extremely vigilant.
 Haryana Roadways bus services to Delhi were also affected in the wake of the events in the national capital, with a senior Transport Department official saying they were assessing the situation.
 Home Secretary Rajeev Arora said the order to suspend mobile internet services in three districts -- Palwal, Sonipat and Jhajjar ' was taken to prevent any disturbance of peace and public order in the districts.
 The order will remain in effect till 5 pm of January 27, he said.
 He said the order covers internet services (2G/ 3G/4G/CDMA/GPRS), all SMS services (excluding banking and mobile recharge) and "all dongle services etc provided on mobile networks except voice calls in territorial jurisdiction of district Sonipat, Palwal and Jhajjar of Haryana State".
 The order was issued in view of the potential law and order situation on account of events in the national capital and to prevent any kind of spread of disinformation and rumours through various social media platforms, he said.
 The three Haryana districts lie adjoining the national capital.
 The Chief Minister later directed all Deputy Commissioners, Commissioners of Police, and Superintendents of Police to remain on 'high alert' so as to ensure the law and order situation in the state is not disturbed, an official statement said.
 Earlier during his Republic Day address in Panchkula, Khattar in an apparent reference to the farmers' stir against the Centre's new farm laws, said one has the freedom to agitate, but not to spread anarchy.
 Khattar described as 'most unfortunate' the incident of a protesting farmer hoisting a flag at the Red Fort, Delhi.
 He said hoisting any flag on the Red Fort other than the tricolour was an insult to the freedom fighters and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the nation.
 In a statement, DGP Yadava said all Commissioners of Police, Range ADGP/IGs and district Superintendents of Police have been asked to be on a high alert to deal strictly with rioters and miscreants.
 Additional force has also been deployed in sensitive areas.
 Besides, the intelligence wing of the police is also monitoring the entire situation, he said.
 The DGP warned that the police will not allow anyone to disturb law and order in the state.
 He also said anyone found instigating riot through any kind of rumour will be strictly dealt with as per the law.
 'Police are also keeping a close eye on social media.
 Strict action will be taken if any kind of misleading, provocative, provoking and anarchic post is shared or forwarded on social media.
 People should not pay attention to the rumours and follow the Haryana Police website and Twitter handle for the latest updates," the DGP added.

NEW DELHI: Over 139 million women and girls in India now use modern methods of contraception, according to a new report released on Tuesday.
 The report published by FP2020, a global partnership that supports the reproductive rights of women and girls, details the progress achieved in family planning over the past eight years.
 In 13 low-income countries, the number of modern contraceptive users has doubled since 2012 and more than 121 million unintended pregnancies, 21 million unsafe abortions, and 1,25,000 maternal deaths were prevented in the last year alone, the report said.
 As a result of contraceptive use in India, more than 54.
5 million unintended pregnancies were prevented, and 1.
8 million unsafe abortions and 23,000 maternal deaths averted in the last year alone.
 In 2017, India updated its FP2020 commitment with two very specific, data-driven pledges: to invest $3 billion of domestic resources in family planning by 2020, and to increase the country's modern contraceptive prevalence for married women from 53.
1 per cent to 54.
3 per cent by 2020, with 74 per cent of the demand for modern contraceptives satisfied.
 Both of those commitments have been fulfilled.
 "India continues to be one of the countries with the highest levels of domestic government expenditure, reflecting the governments' commitment to its family planning programmes," the report said.
  "This year's data includes estimates for 54 countries amounting to nearly $1.
6 billion in spending.
 Most of that figure is attributable to just five countries: India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Philippines," it said.
 In India, over 139 million women and girls now use a modern method of contraception, it further said.
 The report said 320 million women and girls in the world's 69 lowest-income countries now have access to family planning, according to new figures released by Family Planning 2020 (FP2020).
 "India continues to be one of the countries with the highest levels of domestic government expenditure, reflecting the governments' commitment to its family planning programmes," the report said.
 Speaking on the occasion, Health minister Harsh Vardhan expressed his gratitude to be part of this momentous event celebrating the crucial Family Planning 2020 partnership and reminded the audience that India has always valued its membership of the Family Planning 2020 partnership.
 He also lauded the invaluable efforts made by the alliance to strengthen family planning services across the world.
 Lauding the alliance for adding great zeal to India's efforts by helping in the creation of synergy between various endeavours in the space of family planning, he observed, "The partnership has played a fundamental role in facilitating exchange of knowledge among member states about latest contraceptives as well as best practices being followed to accelerate adoption of family planning services by the general population".
 Vardhan underscored the importance of the FP partnership in helping India fulfil its objectives in family planning.
 Summing up India's achievements, he noted, "Improving the quality of contraceptives, augmenting contraceptive demand through comprehensive IEC campaigns, and focused interventions in high fertility districts through Mission Parivar Vikas, have been few of the country's notable achievements.
 As a result, we have witnessed an impressive decline in fertility and maternal mortality in the last few years.
 We continue to strive to substantially reduce the unmet need for contraception by 2030.
" On India's proposed contribution to the next phase of Family Planning Partnership, Vardhan stated: "We realize that advancing collaborations, adopting a more focused approach, and addressing the needs of young population will be of prime importance.
 India remains committed towards this global agenda.
 The overall aim thus, is to plan and implement this refurbished approach with the vision that every child is wanted, every birth is safe, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity.

NEW DELHI: After hours of chaos during their tractor parade in Delhi against the Centre's new agri laws on Tuesday, thousands of protesting farmers, including those at the Red Fort and Mukarba Chowk, started returning to their sit-in sites at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders.
 Wielding sticks and clubs and holding the tricolour and union flags, tens of thousands of farmers atop tractors broke barriers, clashed with police and entered the city from various points to lay siege to the Red Fort and climb the flagpole on Republic Day on Tuesday.
 A protesting farmer died at Delhi's ITO after his tractor overturned.
 The farmers draped the body in the tricolour and kept it at the ITO crossing, not allowing the police to send it for post-mortem.
 Police also had to use lathicharge and teargas shells to control unruly protesters at multiple locations in the city.
 "There is no protesting farmer at ITO crossing and the situation is under control," an official said.
  However, there were still around 500 protesting farmers in the Red Fort till Tuesday late evening while at Mukarba Chowk, hundreds of farmers started moving back to the Singhu border points, another official said.
 Tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in multiple places, leading to chaos in well known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers' two-month peaceful movement in tatters.
 Farmers' union body Samyukta Kisan Morcha disassociated itself from those who indulged in violence during the tractor parade, and alleged that some "antisocial elements" infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.
 The union also condemned and regretted the "undesirable" and "unacceptable" events as the parade turned violent after several groups of farmers deviated from the pre-decided route for the march.
 Later in the day, the Morcha called off the tractor parade by farmers and appealed to participants to immediately return to their respective protest sites.
 "We have called off the farmers' Republic Day parade with immediate effect and appealed to all participants to immediately return back to their respective protest sites.
 The movement will continue peacefully and further steps will be discussed and decided soon," the farmers' union body said in a statement.
  Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.
