Biden admin withdraws move to rescind work authorisation for H-1B spouses
MUMBAI: The steps that were underway, by the Trump administration to rescind the employment authorisation program, for certain categories of spouses of H-1B visa holders, is history
 Nearly a lakh Indian spouses can now breathe a sigh of relief
 Way back in February 2019, when the Trump administration began to take concrete steps towards rescinding this employment authorisation program, US Vice-President Kamala Harris (who was then a Senator) had tweeted, 'This is outrageous and will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists and academics among others to abandon their professional careers
 I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal and will continue to fight this
' Nearly two years later, this fight comes to an end
 This is outrageous & will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to a'¦ https://t
co/gBvwDqpTmp— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) 1550869727000The proposed rule - 'Removing H-4 dependent spouses from the class of aliens eligible for employment authorisation' was under review by the Office of Management and Business (OMB)
 In other words, it was in its final stages of a roll-out
 Soon after the Biden administration stepped in, it stayed for a 60-day period, subject to further extensions, various proposed policies including the proposal to rescind the employment authorisation program
 Now, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has formally withdrawn this proposed rule
 Spouses of H-1B workers are given an H-4 visa
 Only in certain cases, such as where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or where the H-1B visa recipient has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, could the H-4 spouse apply for an employment authorisation document
 To take care of the decades-long green card backlog for certain sections, such as applicants from India, the Obama administration in 2015 had introduced the 'H-4 Employment Authorization Document (EAD) rule
' Given that the expected wait time for Indians caught in the backlog of the employment-based green card for EB-2 and EB-3 (skilled category) runs to 84 years, according to a CATO Institute study ' the EAD program proved to be very useful, especially for families struggling to survive on a single income
 According to the latest available official data, up to December, 2017, nearly 84,360 Indian spouses (largely wives) held an EAD (this was 93% of the total EADs issued)
 The number of such Indian spouses is now estimated to be over a lakh
 The EAD program meant more than financial freedom by enabling them to take up jobs or be self-employed, as the work authorisation also enabled spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license
 SaveH4EAD, a group that started in December 2017, which currently has an outreach of several thousands has tweeted, 'After years of advocacy, meeting Congress members, DHS/OMB and collecting irrefutable data on value-add of H4-EAD not only to economy but also to provide life of dignity to thousands of immigrants, we are pleased to announce that the new administration has withdrawn regulation to help #SaveH4EAD
' After years of advocacy, meeting congress members, DHS/OMB & collecting irrefutable data on value add of H4EAD not'¦ https://t

 Plans to return or migrate elsewhere emerge for over 80,000 Indian families in USThe H4-EAD program has been involved in a long-drawn lawsuit filed by Save Jobs USA, which states that the EAD program takes away American jobs
 Lately delays in getting the EAD extensions in a timely manner, has led to many H-4 visa holders filing lawsuits across the country
 The next step according to SaveH4EAD is to streamline the process so that no one loses their jobs owing to processing delays
 Todd Schulte, President of FWD
us, a bipartisan political organisation, whose founders include Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and others stated, 'We commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking immediate action to turn the page from the Trump-Pence Administration's disastrous immigration policies, and to do right by more than 100,000 hardworking immigrants who are contributing to the United States every single day in the midst of a deadly pandemic
 Allowing H-4 visa holders the ability to continue working and providing for their families has profound, life-changing effects for these individuals and our communities
 Roughly 93 percent are women, and many are working in essential roles that are key to supporting our nation's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic
' 'At the end of the day, there is no successful economic or public health recovery without bold action from lawmakers to protect immigrant essential workers and keep immigrant families safe and together
 Congress must work together to immediately pass the U
S
 Citizenship Act of 2021, which would formalize work authorization for H-4 visa holders, create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrant essential workers, and address the bureaucratic backlogs that plague our broken immigration system,' added Schulte

Union Budget 2021: The case for a higher standard deduction
NEW DELHI: With work from home becoming the new normal, it is going to be difficult for the finance minister to separate salary from business income
 Raising the standard deduction for salaried employees may help level the field
Two years ago, in July 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her maiden budget -- and the first Budget of the second term of the NDA government
 In that Budget, she hiked the standard deduction for salaried employees to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000
 Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageThe standard deduction is an amount that is deducted from an individual's salaried taxable income, thus reducing the taxable income
 Clearly, if the government wants to put more money in the hands of the taxpayer (as it may need to in order to boost demand that has been choked by Covid-related lockdowns), a substantial increase in the standard deduction makes sense
 Except that the finance minister, in the Budget presented in February 2020, had eliminated the standard deduction for taxpayers who opted to enter a new tax regime where lower tax slabs were offered to those who forgo the standard deduction and a host of other exemptions
 These tax slabs are 5 to 10 percentage points lower than the older slabs -- at the lower end of the income scale
 At the higher end (income of Rs 15 lakh plus), the tax rate remains the same
 Tax mavens have discussed the new scheme at length, and see it as the government's first, exploratory move into a no-exemption regime
 Is this fair to salaried employees? In an article written in June 2019 by EY, it was made clear that income-tax rules seem skewed against salaried employees
 While businesspeople and consultants can claim exemptions against all kinds of expenses every month, salaried employees have far fewer options
 Tax is deducted at source by the employer, significantly reducing take-home pay
 New, or old: Which tax regime makes the most sense for you?EY also offered a hypothetical case of a salaried employee and a consultant
 Both make the same gross income of Rs 30 lakh, one as salary and one as fees
 Post tax, however, the story is vastly different
 The salaried employee pays Rs 6
73 lakh in taxes
 The consultant, meanwhile, pays Rs 2
18 lakh
 The salaried employee takes home Rs 4
55 lakh less than the consultant
 The finance ministry disagreed with this reading
 In a written response, the ministry said: 'The tax paid on taxable salary income and on gross amount of professional receipts cannot be compared as the taxable income in case of professionals is computed after allowing all the expenses incurred for carrying-out the profession
 These expenses include rent for office space, salaries & wages of employees, electricity expenses for the office, printing & stationery etc
 However, in respect of a salaried individual, there is no requirement to maintain any office and the office expenses are borne by the employer
 The only major expenses required to be incurred by a salaried individual for earning salary income is the expense incurred for commuting to the office
 For this purpose and other miscellaneous petty expenses which a salaried individual might have to incur, a standard deduction is allowed to the salaried taxpayer which is currently Rs
 50,000
' The purpose of the EY piece was not to question the expenses legitimately allowed to professionals
 Rather, it was to highlight the fact that salaried employees had very few options to claim equally legitimate expenses
 Now more than ever, people are working from home and are using computers and phones for official work
 But they are not allowed to claim even a part of what they spend on buying such equipment as deduction from income
 Some countries, such as Denmark and South Korea, allow such deductions to salary earners, and this is something the government could seriously consider now that 'work from home' is not just accepted but necessary
 Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe few deductions that are allowed to the salaried are unrealistically lower than the actual cost of the services
 For instance, the limits for children's education allowance (Rs 100 per month per child, up to two children) and hostel allowance (Rs 300 per month per child, up to two children) were last revised almost two decades ago
 The government's claim that standard deduction of Rs 50,000 will take care of incidental expenses rings somewhat hollow
 EY said the re-introduced standard deduction subsumed the tax-exempt transport allowance ' an annual figure of Rs 19,200 and the medical reimbursement that could be claimed up to Rs 15,000
 In short, the end benefit was just an annual incremental net reduction in taxable income of Rs 5,800
 Now compare this to what a professional can claim
 For starters, there's the presumptive tax scheme
 Under this, professionals can file their return declaring 50% of their gross returns (subject to gross receipts not exceeding Rs 50 lakh)
 After the tax-saving investments under Section 80 are accounted for, the professional needs to pay tax only on the balance income
 Of course, receipts in excess of Rs 50 lakh will need to be audited and the actual expenses as per the audited accounts are allowed as a deduction
 While presumptive tax has really helped smaller and medium-sized professionals, it has resulted in stark disparity between salaried employees and consultants with the same income
 The finance ministry disagrees, and says that in the case of presumptive tax, 'it is presumed that 50% of his gross receipts are expended towards various expenses required to be incurred for carrying out his profession
 However, this is not a standard deduction and it has also been provided in the Act that if the professional incurs expenses less than 50% of the gross receipts, then he has to declare the higher income
' The previous finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley, saw this in a different light
 In his 2018-19 budget speech, Jaitley highlighted the fact that an average salary earner pays three times more income tax (Rs 76,306) than a non-salaried taxpayer does (Rs 25,753) ' both figures from the budget speech
 It will be interesting to see how the finance ministry deals with the issues of presumptive tax and standard deduction in a year when almost the entire country worked out of home
 The pandemic-induced lockdown and subsequent restrictions on movement meant that salaried employees and professionals alike spent on office infrastructure at home
 This new normal is unlikely to vanish in a hurry
 Will the upcoming Budget take this into account when framing the new tax rules? (A version of this article was published in July 2019)

 We might do another RT-PCR test as a formality

Red Fort raider Deep Sidhu has been quoting Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale
BATHINDA: Punjabi actor-singer-activist Deep Sidhu, who farmer unions allege was responsible for taking youths towards Red Fort on Tuesday, has been making news from the beginning of the agitation since September last year
 Famous for his role as a gangster in the Punjabi film 'Jora Das Numberia' in 2018, the 36-year-old was one of the first celebrities to support farmers when they took to the roads against the three laws
 Before moving to the protest site at Singhu border, Deep Sidhu, who belongs to Muktsar in Punjab, had held a prolonged protest at Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana, where accusations of Khalistani elements running the protests had been made

 (PTI)Farmers protest: Live updatesDuring the Lok Sabha elections in May 2019, Deep Sidhu was in the news for being close to Bollywood actor-politician Sunny Deol, who contested from Gurdaspur as a BJP candidate
 Deep Sidhu was seen participating in his campaign
 However, Deol distanced himself from Sidhu in a tweet, saying he or his family had no relationship with him
 Raid Fort: When rampaging mob took ramparts by stormA video clip featuring Deep Sidhu raising slogans at the Red Fort has also gone viral since Tuesday afternoon
 Later, in a video on his Facebook account, Deep Sidhu said when genuine rights or concerns are not addressed, anger is bound to flare up in any protest
 'We cannot accuse any individual for whatever happened
 Protests as big as this are not dependent on an individual
 We reached Red Fort to symbolically register our protest, to exercise our democratic right and not to challenge the unity and diversity of the country
 We have put up Nishan Sahib and Kisan flag on an empty post
 The Tricolour was not removed
 No one should see it in a communal light
 It was part of unity in diversity
 Nishan Sahib symbolises the fight against injustice,' it said
 Deep Sidhu &amp; government agencies behind rampage: Farm netasHe was till recently close to gangster-turned activist Lakha Sidhana who was seen trying to pacify protesting youths on Monday at Singhu border and objected to the route of the rally allowed by the police
 Sidhu, who claims to be a supporter of the idea of strengthening the federal structure to give more rights to states, has long been openly quoting Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale
 The NIA had last month registered a case against Sikhs for Justice and had also issued notices to Sidhu and his brother Mandeep Singh
 Considered close to Sikh ideologue Ajmer Singh, Sidhu practised as a lawyer before he joined the show business in 2015
